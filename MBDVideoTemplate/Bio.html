<p class="p1"><b>Penny Thomas</b></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
    <p class="p2">South African Jiu Jitsu star, Penny Thomas, has been competitively involved in sports since the age of 5. She was part of the SA Junior Olympic Gymnastics Team before finding her way into Jiu Jitsu, which she started more for the Self Defense aspects.</p><br>
    
<p class="p2">    She resigned from her full time job as a software developer to go on tour & become South Africa’s first Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt. Her titles include:</p><br>
    
<p class="p2">• 4 x Jiu Jitsu World Champion</p>
<p class="p2">• ADCC World Champion</p> 
<p class="p2">• FILA Grappling World Champion</p>
<p class="p2">• Pan American Champion</p> 
<p class="p2">• Grapplers Quest World Champion</p><br>
    
<p class="p2">    These days, when Penny is not training Jiu Jitsu, Judo or Wrestling, and she is not on the Jiu Jitsu Pro Tour competing, her time is spent teaching Self Defense workshops, leading Yoga classes, holding Jiu Jitsu seminars and personal training a few select clients. She also loves being outdoors in nature and in the ocean, playing on the Stand-Up Paddle board & Scuba Diving.</p><br>
    
<p class="p2">    To schedule trainings or for any further information, please feel free to contact Penny @ <a href="mailto:PennyFighting@hotmail.com">PennyFighting@hotmail.com</a>
